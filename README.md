# syncthing

This is a set of scripts to package a DroboApp from scratch, i.e., download sources, unpackage, compile, install, and package in a TGZ file. Now updated for Syncthing 2.0.x!

## Using precompiled binary

This makes use of the precompiled binary for arm processors.  This means using Syncthing's built in auto-update should work fine.  Also this was only tested on Drobo 5N2. However, the repository this was forked from was tested on a Drobo 5N.

## Configuration notes

* Because of how DroboApps are contained in the DroboApps share, this does not setup the default `Sync` folder that's created on new installations since it would be within that DroboApps folder.
* Web address is hard coded to `0.0.0.0:8384` or else it would have started listening on `127.0.0.1` which wouldn't be too helpful (where 0.0.0.0 is replaced by your Drobo's IP).
* When sharing folders can use `/mnt/DroboFS/Shares/` to get to all your current shares and can then specify a directory.

## I just want to install the DroboApp, what do I do?

Check the [releases](https://github.com/dhomas1/droboapp-syncthing/releases) page. If there are no releases available, then you have to compile.

* Place the compiled `tgz` file in the `DroboApps` share, or `scp` the file to `/mnt/DroboFS/Shares/DroboApps`.
* Either run `/usr/bin/DroboApps.sh install` on command line or restart drobo to install

## How to compile

First make sure that you have a [working cross-compiling VM](https://github.com/droboports/droboports.github.io/wiki/Setting-up-a-VM).

Log in the VM, pick a temporary folder (e.g., `~/build`), and then do:

```
git clone https://github.com/dhomas1/droboapp-syncthing.git
cd droboapp-syncthing
./build.sh
ls -la *.tgz
```

Each invocation creates a log file with all the generated output.

* `./build.sh distclean` removes everything, including downloaded files.
* `./build.sh clean` removes everything but downloaded files.
* `./build.sh package` repackages the DroboApp, without recompiling.
